On October 31, 2018, Taiwan’s legislature passed the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professional Talent to attract and retain more international professionals in Taiwan. Among the ten new incentives introduced was the Employment Gold Card. 
The card offers a work permit, resident visa, alien resident certificate, and re-entry permit. It also provides eligibility for a discount in income tax. Cardholders’ direct descendants can also apply for a visitor visa, allowing multiple entries with a total stay not exceeding one year.
Professionals from eight different fields, including Economy, Science & Tech, Education, Culture & Arts, Sports, Finance, Law, and Architecture, can apply for the Gold Card. 
Due to its benefits, Taiwan hopes to attract more international talent through different incentives and promote industrial development and transformation.
