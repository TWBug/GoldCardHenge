Launched in 2018, the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a 4-in-1 card, that includes a resident visa, work permit, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC), and re-entry permit, which allows you to leave and re-enter Taiwan multiples times over the course of 1-3 years. Applicants can apply online without sponsorship. 

## Four-in-One

* Work Permit: Allows cardholders to seek employment freely, obtain employment at any time, work any part-time job legally, and freely change jobs.
* Resident Visa:  Long-term visa which allows cardholders to stay in Taiwan for more than 180 days.
* Alien Resident Certificate:  A physical ID card proving that you can live in Taiwan legally.
* Re-entry Permit:  Allows unlimited entry and exit from Taiwan (even during COVID-19).

Qualification is based on an assessment of your professional skills. You don't need to have already secured a job in Taiwan. The Gold Card costs anywhere between USD 100 and USD 310 depending on your nationality and the duration of the card.

A perfect application takes 30-days, however, if additional supporting documents are requested, expect a time frame of 50-60 days.
