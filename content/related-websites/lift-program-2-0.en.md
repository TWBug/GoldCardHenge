To strengthen Taiwan's position in the current global competition for talents, meet the need for scientific research manpower in Taiwan, attract talents back to Taiwan from overseas, and support the government's forward-looking infrastructure development and industrial innovation policies, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) initiated the Leaders in Future Trends (LIFT 1.0) Program in 2017. With the goals of stimulating industrial innovation and fostering technological leaps, this program has sought to recruit Taiwanese talents studying and working aboard to contribute their expertise back to Taiwan.
