# About the Gold Card Office

"Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office" was created in October 2020 by the National Development Council, to serve as a single point of contact for the recruitment and assistance of foreign professionals working in Taiwan, under the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals.

## The Gold Card Office has three main objectives:

1. To promote the program through online platforms and community networks, increasing its reach to potential candidates and the recruitment of target applicants.
2. To provide a single point of contact for questions about the program and its application process, and to assist successful applicants in their social integration with Taiwan.
3. To create a professional website for a global audience, providing a streamlined gateway to the program and working in Taiwan.
