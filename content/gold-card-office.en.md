# About the Gold Card Office

The Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office was created in October 2020 by the National Development Council,
 to serve as a single point of contact for the recruitment and assistance of foreign professionals
working in Taiwan, under the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals.


The Taiwan Gold Card Office has staff dedicated to answering your questions, and if we don't know
the answer we can help introduce you to other government departments that will.
