Taiwan has an abundance of available resources, and many of them are perfect for entrepreneurs. To kickstart your journey, the Taiwan Gold Card Office has invited four representatives from different government agencies that support Tech, Innovation, and Creative Arts and Content. We have also invited John Chen, a Gold Card member and cofounder from Hive Ventures to share about his experience setting up and investing in Taiwan. Please remember to register on Accupass! Coffee/Tea and light snacks will be provided.
