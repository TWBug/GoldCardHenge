The Gold Card office will be holding a Business Registration Workshop for all Gold Card Holders! At this workshop, we will be covering the basics of registering your business in Taiwan.

We will collect questions from Gold Card Holders before the event and will address as many as we can on the day of the event. If you have any questions, please remember to let us know on the registration form or email us at hello@taiwangoldcard.tw. Please note that we will avoid very specific scenarios and opt for general questions that we feel the majority can relate to. We will stop collecting questions on Monday, 01/18.
