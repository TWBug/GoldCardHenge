The holiday season is upon us, and what better way to celebrate than with a party!? Join us on Wednesday, 12/23 at Theater Trattoria for a night filled with fun, food, networking, and general merriment! 

The National Development Council and the Taiwan Gold Card Office has teamed up with Crossroads to cohost our very first Christmas Mixer! This Christmas Mixer is not only a chance for Gold Card holders to celebrate, but also a great opportunity for you to network with the local Taiwanese community.
