The National Development Council and Employment Gold Card Office cordially invites you to attend our Happy Hour event! We will prepare some light snacks! 

\*Please note that there is a 400NT minimum per person at the restaurant 

This event is a great opportunity for Gold Card holders to meet and socialize with each other and experience a new restaurant at the same time! You can also have a fun time exploring Maji Square, one of Taipei's most unique and fun places to shop, eat, and hangout. Happy Hour prices will go until 8:00PM on the day of the event as a special courtesy by the owner!
