By popular request, the Taiwan Employment Gold Card office will be holding a Basic Tax Workshop for all Gold Card Holders! Every foreigner's tax situation is different, but we believe that there are certain things that every person must know. At this workshop, we will be covering 2 basic topics:

How to file personal taxes
How to open a bank account 
Aside from these topics, we will be collecting questions from Gold Card Holders before the event and will address as many as we can on the day of the event. If you have any questions, please remember to let us know on the registration form or email us at hello@taiwangoldcard.tw. Please note that we will generally avoid very specific scenarios and opt for questions that we feel the majority can relate to. We will stop collecting questions on Friday, 11/20.
