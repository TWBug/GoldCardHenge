# Taiwan’s Modern & Contemporary Art Museums

Although Taiwan spans a modest 36,000 square kilometers, the island is home to over 220 museums. These range from the globally renowned National Palace Museum, to the lesser-known and quirkier Teng Feng Fish Ball Museum, Miniatures Museum of Taiwan, Taiwan Balloon Museum, and the Republic of Chocolate. 

In addition to the myriad institutions that highlight the island’s rich and extensive cultural history, Taiwan is also home to several world-class modern and contemporary art museums. With their fingers on the pulse of the contemporary art heartbeat, these museums bring the latest trends and innovations to our front door while amplifying contemporary Taiwanese art on the global stage.

Established in 1983, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM) was the first public museum in Taiwan dedicated to modern and contemporary art. Since its inception, it has pioneered the development of fine art on the island and has played a significant role in cultivating public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of art. In addition to organizing exhibitions of both established and rising local artists, TFAM is known for holding large-scale international art exhibitions where visitors can see works by renowned international artists like Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Yayoi Kusama, and more. With the annual Taipei Art Awards, TFAM nurtures and promotes up-and-coming Taiwanese artists, while with the Taipei Biennial, TFAM provides a platform for showcasing the latest and greatest in the global contemporary art scene.

On October 4th, 2021, TFAM announced its plan for expansion, which will include the construction of a second museum building that is scheduled to open in 2026.

The Tainan Art Museum consists of two buildings. The smaller Building 1 was originally constructed in 1931 as the Tainan Police Department, the oldest police station in Taiwan. It was renovated and later re-opened as TNAM in 2018. One year later and one block away, the construction of Building 2 was completed under the direction of award-winning Japanese architect Ban Shigeru. Given its location in Tainan, the historical capital and cultural heart of Taiwan, the TNAM’s foremost objective is to uncover, construct, and activate Taiwan’s local art history and consolidate it into a contemporary cultural identity. The museum’s mission to cultivate art appreciation and cultural value is reflected in its exhibitions, which often explore themes like Taiwanese folk religions and beliefs.

The National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (NTMoFA) is located in the West District of Taichung. Established in 1988, it is the first and only national fine arts museum in Taiwan. Its collections and exhibitions are primarily devoted to showcasing works by modern and contemporary Taiwanese artists. In particular, every two years NTMoFA holds the Taiwan Biennial, a special exhibition that not only gives the visitors access to a compendium of Taiwan’s most innovative contemporary art, but also provides a platform for Taiwanese artists to exchange their knowledge and views on art.

Along the perimeter of the building, visitors will find 45 different sculptures located throughout the NTMoFA Sculpture and Calligraphy Steles Park. The sculptures take on a wide range of styles, from traditional calligraphy to contemporary installation art, ultimately reflecting the rich diversity of the Taiwanese art world. Including the sculpture park, NTMoFA spans a total area of 10 hectares, making it one of the largest art museums in Asia.
