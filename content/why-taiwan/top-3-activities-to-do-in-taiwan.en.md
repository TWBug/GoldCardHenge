# Top 3 Activities to do in Taiwan

What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Taiwan? Is it the variety of fresh, tropical fruits or the drool-inducing night market food? Aside from being a food paradise, Taiwan also offers an abundance of spectacular landscapes and scenery. Despite its size, many know Taiwan for its magnificent landscapes; surrounded by crystal blue ocean waters and luscious green mountains. Many locals believe that the top three must-do activities while you are in Taiwan are swimming across Sun Moon Lake, summiting Jade Mountain, and touring the entire island. Wondering where to start? Let us point you in the right direction!

## Swimming across Sun Moon Lake

Sun Moon Lake is a beautiful freshwater alpine lake located in Nantou County. Lalu land, situated in the middle of the lake, separates the lake into two parts: one shaped like a crescent moon and the other shaped like a round sun - hence the name Sun Moon Lake. Since 1983, Taiwan has held the Sun Moon Lake Swimming Carnival, where participants gather at the Chaowu Wharf to swim across the 3km long 0.1 km wide lake, and finish at the Yidashao Wharf. Every year, the carnival attracts thousands of swimming enthusiasts and courageous adventurers across the island to participate. In 2006, a record number of 20,000 swimmers joined the event and spots were filled the moment sign-up sheets were released. The event is open to those above the age of 10 and does require a certain level of agility and endurance to complete. If you want to experience this exciting event be sure to sign-up fast or you may be left watching from the sidelines!

## Summiting Jade Mountain

Yushan, or Jade Mountain, is located in Chiayi County at the highest peak of the Baiyue Mountains in Taiwan. The whole trail is approximately 61.2 km at an altitude of 3 km and up. Those who have trekked up Jade Mountain say that the hike itself is not particularly hard, but the real challenge is reserving a spot at Paiyun Lodge. Good news is that if you are a foreigner visiting Taiwan you have an advantage as during the weekdays they reserve 24 spots for those who hold foreign passports. Keep in mind that applications must be submitted 35 days prior to the scheduled entry date or 4 months in advance. Hiking Jade Mountain can be exhausting, but is definitely worth it when you stand on the peak and witness the impeccable views.

## Touring the Island of Formosa

Compared to other countries, touring the island is not difficult since Taiwan is about 377 kms long from north to south, 142 kms wide from east to west, and the coastline around the island is about 1,200 kms. Although not particularly large, Taiwan covers an area of ​​36,193 square kms, and its mountain and ocean scenery is not one to miss. You can complete a week around the island through various means of transportation, whether it’s hiking, biking, driving, or taking the train. Below are some common transportation methods people have used to complete the round-island trip. 

**Railway Transportation**

The Taiwan Railway has a package deal specifically for a round-island trip: the Taiwan Railway TR-PASS ticket. Within the time period marked on the ticket, the individual can take unlimited rides on the railway, getting on and off and making stops along the way as you please. Getting to know Taiwan through riding the railway is a memorable experience, as most of the train stops are large stations with many attractions and local food options to enjoy. Once you hop off the train, you can easily take a bus or taxi to the attractions you want to see. 

*Note: A 3-day trip ticket is currently NTD$1800 and the 5-day trip ticket is NTD$2500.*

**Bicycle Transportation**

Cycling around the island is one that requires a strong mindset and an undeniable amount of physical endurance and strength. If you are unsure what cycling routes to take, the government has a round-island route set up for those willing to take on the challenge: the Cycle 1 Route, also Taiwan’s main bicycle route. The total length of the route is around 939.5 kms (excluding the Su-Hwa highway). This route is mainly based on Provincial Highway 3 and Provincial Highway 1 in the western part of Taiwan,  and Provincial Highway 9 in the eastern part of Taiwan, which connects a series of places such as the bike rest stops, convenience stores, Taiwan railway station, tourist centers, and famous attractions. There is a supply store every 20 km along the route, so if you need to rest or are in need of bike repair services, rest assured that there are plenty. The routes around Yilan to Hualien may be particularly difficult because the bike lanes are more narrow.

*Cycle 1 Route: Keelung --> Taipei --> New Taipei --> Taoyuan --> Hsinchu --> Taichung --> Changhwa --> Yunlin --> Chiayi --> Tainan --> Kaohsiung --> PingTung --> Taitung --> Hualien --> Yilan --> Keelung*

**Car or Motorcycle Transportation**

Motorcycles and scooters are a defining characteristic of Taiwan’s road traffic. Motorcycles are an easy mode of transportation and riders encounter fewer parking problems, and for that they are considered more convenient than driving around the island. However, motorcyclists must withstand varying weather conditions which may delay their trip. Despite these drawbacks, traveling on a car or motorcycle provides more flexibility in terms of timing and physical ability than compared to cycling around the island. For those who like to make spontaneous detours or changes in their itineraries, choosing to drive or motorcycle would be the optimal choice.
