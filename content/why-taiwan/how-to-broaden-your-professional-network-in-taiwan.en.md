## TIP 1: BE HONEST ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS

Be honest about what outcomes you want to achieve long term, and be clear and upfront about your goals for networking. 

Whether you are seeking internships, mentors, business advice, visa advice, potential business prospects, or a new career, it's best to be direct about your intentions from the start. Be honest with yourself first, so you can be sincere to those in your network.

## TIP 2: MAKE A LIST OF THE TYPES OF PEOPLE YOU WANT TO MEET

Your time is finite, and so is the time of people you connect with. Networking requires time, effort, and planning, so try to identify the types of people you would like to focus your networking on. 

Think about potential hiring managers, specific VC’s, other senior leaders or experts in your desired field. Growing your network in terms of relevant quality is better than growing it in terms of random quantity.

For instance, as a job seeker, identify the companies that you would like to work for, that align with your values, and where you can see yourself growing professionally. Take a look at job postings on job boards (or even Facebook) and start cross-referencing HR staff on LinkedIn, if you’d like to directly enquire about relevant opportunities.
