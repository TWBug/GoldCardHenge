# Seeking Professional Opportunities in Taiwan

Whether you are searching for a senior role in an existing company, considering changing companies, or simply ready to take the next step in your career, it is vital to know where to look. While finding a new opportunity can seem daunting, there are a few things you can do to ensure that you are searching efficiently and effectively. In this article, we list a few pointers on how to find professional opportunities in Taiwan.

## Where should I look?

As with job searches in any country, one should canvas far and wide. Here’s a list of some of the best-known online resources:

* Job Search Websites

  1. 104.com
  2. Yourator
  3. CakeResume
  4. LinkedIn
  5. Glassdoor
* Facebook Groups

  1. Working in Taiwan – The largest group for (foreigner-focused) employment in Taiwan
  2. Non-Teaching Jobs in Taiwan – A large, active group dedicated to connecting job seekers and companies with openings
  3. Non-Teaching Jobs in Kaohsiung – Job-seeking group focused on Kaohsiung and Southern Taiwan

In addition to this list, you can use LinkedIn to connect with recruiters and current employees of companies you are interested in. If your home country has a trade office or chamber of commerce in Taiwan, check with them as well. Search regularly for upcoming job fairs.

## How long does it take to find a job?

Finding a job in Taiwan often takes longer than expected. As frustrating as this can be, do your best to manage this time proactively. You may need to consider taking part-time roles, volunteering, or doing an internship. The tricky combination of a low number of openings for each field, an abundance of competing job seekers, and unpredictable hiring processes and periods can significantly prolong your job search. It can be helpful to discuss your experiences with friends to share tips and learn from one another’s experiences.

## How much will/should you be paid?

This is a never-ending debate that for many seems to only ever be answered as “not enough.” The exception here is for high-demand, highly-skilled talent such as mobile engineers, who can command a premium. Regardless of the job and your skillset, you’ll do well to negotiate for the highest salary you can secure. The good news is that with 12-18 months of experience working in Taiwan on your resume, you will be in a position to negotiate for a significant raise at your next job(s). For experienced and managerial candidates, salaries vary widely, so it is advised that you do your research and negotiate the best deal possible.

## Any final tips?

Networking is the most important thing one can do to find work in Taiwan. This is true not only for your first job here but also for freelance work and future roles. While it is certainly possible to secure a job without much networking, it’s advised that you expand and engage your professional network as much as you can. Job offers and partnerships can arise from unexpected places and occasions. Go to happy hours, go to job fairs, and consider staying in touch with that person you chat with at the café or bar may also be looking for a career change. Every connection you make could be key to building your career here.
