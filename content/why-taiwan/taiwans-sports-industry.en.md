# Taiwan’s Diverse Sports Industry

Taiwan is a small, but dense island, with a total population of 24 million and land area of approximately 36,000 square kilometers. Though the Taiwanese sports industry is not something extraordinary, in recent years, citizens have started to put more time and effort into physical fitness. The government and private sectors have also begun putting more focus and emphasis on developing the country’s sports industry, causing the industry to grow. 

## Baseball

Baseball is often considered as Taiwan’s national sport. Since the Japanese occupation of Taiwan to present day, Taiwan has developed a complete training and league system that has brought about many talented Taiwanese baseball players. Many domestic professional baseball stars and foreign players have come from this long-established system. The Chinese Professional Baseball League is the first professional sports league established in Taiwan. It consists of five organizations, four have teams in the main league, one in the farm league, and has Major (一軍) and Minor (二軍) leagues. Taiwan’s professional baseball leagues utilize methods from different countries as references to better strengthen their program. Should foreign players want to be accepted into the league, they must play at the Triple-A level or have been in the Major Leagues.
