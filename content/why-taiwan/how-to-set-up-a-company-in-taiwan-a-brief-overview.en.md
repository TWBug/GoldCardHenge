# How to Set Up a Company in Taiwan: A Brief Overview

The key topic of this article revolves around the initial process of setting up a company and important differences between starting companies designated in Taiwan as Limited, Close, and Limited by Shares. On average, it takes at least 3 weeks to set up a company, and the most convenient method is to consult a CPA who can assist you in processing all your paperwork and documents.

Let’s look at the key processes of setting up any company first:

1. Prepare foreign documents (notarized, if applicable)
2. Apply for your Branch Name (your CPA can help you pick a suitable Chinese name)
3. If applicable, apply for Special Permissions
4. Designation of the Foreign Head Office
5. Open company bank account, then remit money
6. If applicable, receive the Special Permissions you applied for in Step 2
7. Show the MOEA the Remittance Papers as proof that you have sent the money, and they will issue you a Tax Number
8. Apply to the City Government to register the Branch Office as a Tax-Paying Unit
9. If applicable, apply to the Bureau of Foreign Trade, MOEA, for Importer/Exporter English Name Reservation
10. Apply for Health and Labor Insurance

**Useful tip: Opening a company account with a bank you use for personal banking will reduce paperwork and ensure that your credit records can pass over seamlessly.**

Now for the important differences between starting companies designated in Taiwan as **Limited**, Close, and **Limited by Shares**. 

The key difference to note is the significant tax advantages of **Close** or **Limited by Shares** companies (0.3% transaction tax) over strictly **Limited** companies (up to 40% income tax rate upon exit or sale under Taiwan income tax laws). A **Limited** company does have its benefits – a single person or group with or without capital can register a company this way, which considers work contributions equal to investment and is not limited by shares. Limited companies can later be converted to **Close** or **Limited by Shares** companies to receive better tax rates.

Another key factor that appeals to many prospective entrepreneurs is the fact that none of the company types require capital to file for business registration in Taiwan. Entrepreneurs and teams looking to get started can earn approval for their application by showing a variety of forms of investment, including cash, credit rights, assets, know-how, technology, and ready labor (see the table below for a breakdown).

When it comes to company structure and decision making, **Limited** is again the simplest, requiring only one Director role to be declared and breaking down voting rights by the ratio of dollars invested. However, for **Close** and **Limited by Shares** companies, management structure, shares, and voting rights are defined by the makeup of the company’s leadership and investors. To give a very general overview of those company structures, both **Close** and **Limited by Shares** companies are recommended to form a board composed of directors and supervisors, although this is not required in all cases. In the case of shares and voting rights, these companies can offer a mix of common, preferred, and deferred shares, which can carry different voting strengths and can become key bargaining chips when dealing with investors and venture capitalists. The table below breaks down this last point clearly.

Another key thing to be aware of is profit sharing and dividends. **Limited** companies are only allowed to pay out dividends on an annual basis, but **Close** and **Limited by Shares** companies can make payouts quarterly, bi-annually, or annually, based on the stipulations of their articles of incorporation (AOI).

Your company must have a Chinese name to be registered in Taiwan. The company can also have a name in any other language, and that can be the name you use in the course of daily business affairs, but any non-Chinese name must be presented and spelled using the characters of the English alphabet (Arabic or Cyrillic languages, for example, would have to be translated or transliterated using English letters for this portion of the registration). Please note that this process requires a specific application and can take up to six months to be approved. It’s recommended that companies prepare more than one name in case their preferred moniker is unavailable or otherwise not approved.

Once the naming process is underway, your company will need to obtain approval for foreign investment, prepare your company chops (official stamps), open a bank account, and designate an office address. Finally, it is then time for your company registration and the part of the process that might be best handled by professionals. 

Here is the list of items for your reference:

* Application form
* FIA approval – approval from Investment Commission
* Articles of Incorporation (AOI)
* Meeting minutes of initial shareholders
* Meeting minutes of directors
* Registration of initial shareholders
* ID documents of directors and supervisors
* Undertaking letter of directors
* ID documents of initial shareholders
* Documents relating to the office (consent letter of the owner of the building/office; copy of the lease agreement)
* Capital verification report issued by CPA
* Corporate registration card (2 copies)
* Application fee

While it is possible to navigate the application process on your own, many of the requirements can be difficult to understand or achieve without professional guidance. It is strongly suggested to hire a lawyer or CPA for many of these needs, as these professionals are experienced in dealing with the litany of documents and requirements that the Business Registration process entails.
