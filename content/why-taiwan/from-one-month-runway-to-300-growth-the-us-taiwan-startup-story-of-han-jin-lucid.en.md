# From one month runway to 300% growth - the US/Taiwan startup story of Han Jin & Lucid

Han Jin, emigrated to Germany from China at age 6.  He grew up in Hamburg, and received his BSc in Management Science & General Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. He then finished his Masters in Engineering from the University of California in Berkeley in 2012.  

After working as a program manager at SanDisk for three years, Han began his dream of being an entrepreneur, founding Lucid in 2015, an computer vision company in California. He was recognized for his accomplishments in Forbes 30 under 30 and Inc 30 Under 30 for consumer technology in 2018.  

Han first came to Taiwan as part of the Garage+ program, joining their first batch of oversea entrepreneurs, and fell in love with Taiwan.  He now spends his time managing Lucid’s cross-border teams in Taipei, Taiwan and San Jose, USA. Here is his story. 

How did you hear about Taiwan?

Back in Silicon Valley, I had heard about some Taiwan startup programs through outreach project managers (which were sponsored by the Ministry of Science & Technology).  So in 2015, I joined the first batch from Garage+, and then also joined the Sparklabs Taipei program at Taiwan Tech Arena in 2018. Through these programs I was able to find hardware manufacturing partners such as Wistron who produced Lucid’s first 3D camera, and develop products which were in partnership with RED in their Hydrogen One smartphone.
