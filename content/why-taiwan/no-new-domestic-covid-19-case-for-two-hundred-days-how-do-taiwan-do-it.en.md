When Taiwan raises its COVID-19 pandemic regulation, there are many public places prohibit of entrance of people with fever symptoms.

Recalling the early days of Taiwanese heard of COVID-19 pandemic, government or citizen are quite nervous. Taiwan Pandemic prevention unit starts assembling in the end of the year, and Taiwanese folks start to gather resources, lining up to buy masks. And they avoid unnecessary shopping and watching movies, eat out in the restaurants. Taiwanese business was hit hard by the pandemic. Most companies start a very strick fever screening and plan to let employees take turns into the office space to split operation.

Taiwan authorities and private sectors are very serious about the pandemic, even play down the optimism message from WHO that says COVD-19 pandemic is not critical. Ten years ago, Taiwan government trusted China and WHO's statement about SARS was not serious, let Taiwan underestimate the situation. Taiwan was hit hard due to its geographic location is close to China, and it was the top three severe countries or areas in the world. There were many beloved people and hospital's staffs got SARS, and it was a painful memory for Taiwanese people. Taiwan learns its lessons from its pass suffering, and not only for the staffs of Central Epidemic Command Center, most of the senior medic staffs of Taiwan's hospitals have experience dealing with the SARS pandemic. Most of them will not underestimate the threat from COVID-19.

When Taiwanese heard news about the mystery pneumonia from Wuhan, China, governments and Taiwanese people are alerted due to previous SARS experience. China is known for its lack of transparency, so it is not trusted by Taiwanese people. And coincidentally Taiwan and China relationship is becoming worse. China used some policy tools like banning China tourist groups coming to Taiwan, decreasing Taiwan and China economic ties, to "punish" Taiwan ruling party for not obeying to China government's orders. Due to China's action , Taiwan avoid the fate of mass import of COVID-19 case from China.
