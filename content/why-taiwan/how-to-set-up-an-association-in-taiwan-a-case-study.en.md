One of the main reasons to open an association is to accept donations from corporate partners and reduce the obstacles to working with governmental organizations and other NGOs.

## The Right Accountant is Crucial 

It can take over a year to finalize an association if you choose the wrong accountant, when it really shouldn’t take longer than six months. It really comes down to the accountant you choose, so pick one who comes highly recommended by friends who have already opened their own companies. Unfortunately, a lot of accountants don’t have any actual experience in setting up an association, but may tell you that they can do it. Instead of wasting your time, find someone with a proven track record of establishing an association.
