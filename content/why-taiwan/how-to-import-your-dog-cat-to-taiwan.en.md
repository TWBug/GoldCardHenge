When we decide to add a pet to the family, it's a life long decision. When moving to another country, of course, our furry friends need to come with us. Importing your cat or dog to Taiwan is not that difficult if you know how! We have created a step-to-step guide and linked it to all essential resources and information to make this as stress-free for owner and pet as possible. 

**Note: We are only talking about standard household pets. If you have a working dog (e.g., Service Dog, Duty Dog, etc.), there might be special regulations. Please read [THIS](https://www.baphiq.gov.tw/en/upload/baphiq/files/web_structure/14261/1-16409.pdf) document for more information.**

Before we can get started, we need to figure out what type of country you are importing your pet from. All countries are divided into either rabies-free or rabies-infected countries. **Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Hawaii state, Territory of Guam, Singapore, Estonia, and Japan** are recognized as rabies-free countries. All other countries are rabies-infected.
