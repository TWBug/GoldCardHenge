# How to import your Dog/Cat to Taiwan?

When we decide to add a pet to the family, it's a life long decision. When moving to another country, of course, our furry friends need to come with us. Importing your cat or dog to Taiwan is not that difficult if you know how! We have created a step-to-step guide and linked it to all essential resources and information to make this as stress-free for owner and pet as possible. 

**Note: We are only talking about standard household pets. If you have a working dog (e.g., Service Dog, Duty Dog, etc.), there might be special regulations. Please read [THIS](https://www.baphiq.gov.tw/en/upload/baphiq/files/web_structure/14261/1-16409.pdf) document for more information.**

Step 1
{{< /teaser >}}

Before we can get started, we need to figure out what type of country you are importing your pet from. All countries are divided into either rabies-free or rabies-infected countries. **Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Hawaii state, Territory of Guam, Singapore, Estonia, and Japan** are recognized as rabies-free countries. All other countries are rabies-infected.

Please call the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan if you would like to confirm. TELï¼š(02)2343-1401

Are we meeting the requirements? 

Before we move on to the actual process of importing your cat/dog, we need to figure out if your pet is meeting the general requirements for import:

1. Implanted with a microchip (Please check with the vet even if you're sure the pet has a microchip. The chip can move or be destroyed by accident) 
2. At least 3-months old and had a rabies shot after reaching the 3-months of age.
3. Up-to-date rabies vaccine, meaning not older than 1-year before import

If you are importing your pet from a recognized rabies-free country, please keep reading. The pet needs to be at least 180-days in the rabies-free country. If you are importing from a rabies-infected country, please CLICK HERE (anchor to below).

* Apply for an Import permit at least 20-days before entry at the port of entry (e.g., if you are flying in from Taoyuan, apply at the Taoyuan customs) 
* There are two ways of applying for an import permit. Either [APPLY ONLINE](https://pet-epermit.baphiq.gov.tw/) or fill out the application form they provide on their [WEBSITE](https://www.baphiq.gov.tw/en/ws.php?id=14261) (scroll to the bottom to find it) and send it via post, fax, or email.
* List of documents you need for the import permit application: 

  * Authentication document of the applicant (e.g., Taiwanese ID, ARC, passport) 
  * Veterinarian signed certificate proof of rabies vaccination. This certificate needs to include the following information: dogs/cats breed, sex, age, microchip number, inoculation date (date of rabies shot, the rabies shot needs to be between 30-365 days before importation to Taiwan) 

**Note: The import permit can be applied before a flight is booked. Choose a date first that you are most likely to import your pet to Taiwan. If the time frame changes after you have successfully applied for the import permit, you can just send them an email and change the date.** 

* Book a flight. Make sure to call or contact the airline directly. Different airlines have different rules & regulations. 

  * Some airlines allow pets in the cabin when they are small enough (e.g. KLM, Lufthansa) 
  * Some airlines only allow pets in cargo (e.g., Eva Air)
  * Some airlines don't allow certain types of pets at all (e.g., Emirates) 
  * Every airline's pricing and rules are different. Please make sure to check on their websites or call for any questions. 
* Get a veterinary certificate issued/stamped by the exporting country. Please use the [FORM](https://www.baphiq.gov.tw/en/upload/baphiq/files/web_structure/14261/20103.pdf) provided by the Taiwanese government.
* When the pet arrives in Taiwan, you will need to submit the following documents to the animal quarantine authority: 

  * Photocopy of the Import Permit
  * Original Export Veterinary Certificate
  * Photocopy of the bill of lading, airway bill, or customs declaration
* **The Taiwanese animal quarantine authority will issue the Import Veterinary Certificate, but only after all the above requirements are met, and the dog/cat gives no cause for suspicion of notifiable animal infectious diseases.**
