* When your application is approved and passed the qualification review, you will receive an e-mail notification to bring your passport for passport inspection. At this point, please bring your original passport to your chosen Bureau of Consular Affairs or ROC mission/office. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some overseas missions might be temporarily closed or working remotely. Please contact their office and see if passport inspections can be accepted via post.
* After verification, you will receive an e-mail stating your passport has been inspected and the gold card application was approved. Under normal circumstances, this process should take a week.
