# Supplementary Documents

After you complete the online payment, the review process officially begins. If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information, or the authorities require more information about your qualifications, you will need to submit additional documents for review.

You will receive an email if this is the case. Log in to the Application Portal to review your application and the request for Supplementary Documents. You can then submit a modified version of your application and upload new documents.

For more information see the [detailed instructions](/en/application/#submitting-additional-documents--rejection).
