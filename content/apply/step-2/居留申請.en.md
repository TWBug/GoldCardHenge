* Choose your validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. The price of the application varies for longer validity periods. Extensions are not possible.
* Please choose the preferred location for collecting your Gold Card.
* If you would like to come to Taiwan as soon as possible you can choose to pick up the Gold Card in Taiwan. You may enter the country on a temporary certificate and collect the card after you arrive. You can collect your card overseas but it can take up to 21-working days for the card to arrive at overseas missions. For detailed instructions to pick up your Gold Card, please refer to Card Collection.
* If you currently don’t have a work address, you can temporarily leave it out during the application and review stage. You may leave your Taiwan relative/friend’s resident address if you have no residence address. However, you must provide a residential address within 30 days of arriving in Taiwan.
* Domestic applications require a resident address when applying. When entering the Taiwanese address in Chinese, only Chinese symbols and Arabic numerals can be used, no English letters allowed.
