* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly transfer to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card.
* If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, or you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you will still need to leave the country and re-enter.
