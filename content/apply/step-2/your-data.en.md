# Your Data

**Basic Data / Passport Data**

* After entering the application page, please fill out your information. All fields with an asterisk are mandatory. Please make sure that the English name is the same as the passport used to enter Taiwan.
* You can save the filled out information at any time, come back to it later, and change before sending it.

**Resident**

* Choose your validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. The price of the application varies for longer validity periods. Extensions are not possible.
* Please choose the preferred location for collecting your Gold Card.
* If you would like to come to Taiwan as soon as possible you can choose to pick up the Gold Card in Taiwan. You may enter the country on a temporary certificate and collect the card after you arrive. You can collect your card overseas but it can take up to 21-working days for the card to arrive at overseas missions. For detailed instructions to pick up your Gold Card, please refer to Card Collection.
* If you currently don’t have a work address, you can temporarily leave it out during the application and review stage. You may leave your Taiwan relative/friend’s resident address if you have no residence address. However, you must provide a residential address within 30 days of arriving in Taiwan.

**Profession**

* Please select the industry that you want to apply through. Please attach all relevant supporting documents. Click save after double-checking and uploading the files.
* After you submit your application, changing the industry can take time for processing, and add to the overall review.
