# Fill in your information / Passport & Visa Status

-   After you have successfully registered, login and select “Employment Gold Card Application” in the “Online Application” menu. Then select your nationality and whether or not you are applying from Taiwan or abroad.
-   You may apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card if you hold a foreign passport, or a ROC passport without household registration (NWHOR). ROC nationals with a household registration or national ID card are not eligible to apply for the Gold Card. If you hold a Taiwan NWHOR passport, when applying domestically, you must enter on your foreign passport and not your Taiwan NWHOR passport or your application will be rejected.
-   If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly transfer to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying, or will need to apply from abroad.
-   If you are applying from abroad or are in Taiwan on a visitor-visa, visa-free, or a non-extendable visa, your passport needs to be inspected. An extra page will appear during the application process, where you can choose the location. If you are in Taiwan, please go to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Central, Southern, Eastern, Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan branches).
-   The application can take over 60 business days assuming you have all the proper documentation submitted. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, or you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you will still need to leave the country and re-enter.

For more information, please refer to the [detailed instructions](/en/application/#online-application).
