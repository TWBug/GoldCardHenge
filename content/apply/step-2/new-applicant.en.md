# New Applicant

{{< teaser prefix="" >}}
If you enter Taiwan with Taiwanese passport, you will not be allowed to apply for the Employment Gold Card domestically. You must submit the application abroad.

* If you enter Taiwan with any of the following visas, you will not be allowed to apply for the Employment Gold Card domestically and must apply from abroad or re-enter Taiwan with another visa:

1. International Conference Visa
2. Trade Exhibition or other Events Visa (IM)
3. Medical Visa (M)
4. Working Holiday Visa (WH)
5. Contracted Employee or Performance Visa (A)
6. Studying Mandarin Chinese Visa (FR)
7. Other visas that clearly state "no extensions"

* Once logged in to the portal, Select Application for Employment Gold Card from the Application menu, then click "New Applicant".
* If you are applying from within Taiwan, be sure to select your current visa carefully as this cannot be changed later. Note that the common "visa exempt" entry is the last item in the list.

* Please remember to double check your passport to confirm your visa situation. If you choose the wrong identity, you will be asked to reapply and not given a refund.

* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly transfer to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card.
* If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, or you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you will still need to leave the country and re-enter.
