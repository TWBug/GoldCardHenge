In order to attract foreign special professionals, the Ministry of Science and Technology has amended its regulations for “Foreign Special Professionals Possessing Special Expertise in Science & Technology”. 

The amendments include:

1. A clarification on Article 1, a qualification for applicants \[previously or currently holding a position at a technology company or in technological fields in a foreign state or in the Republic of China (hereafter referred to as “Taiwan”) with a most recent monthly salary of at least NTD160,000.] The amendment retracts the original request requiring applicants to also attach documents proving unique experience in R&D or outstanding innovation achievements. Instead, applicants need only provide documents verifying salary or income tax payment relating to employment at a technology company, or in a technological field, and a personal curriculum vitae and document verifying domestic or foreign service relating to employment at a technology company, or in a technological field.
2. Added qualifications in regards to individuals who have practical innovation experience (Article 10 and Article 12)
3. Added qualifications in regards to individuals who contribute to Taiwan’s science and technology fields (Article 13)
4. Relaxation on certain required supporting documents. Instead of providing a \[Doctorate Diploma] , a \[Foreign or Domestic Diploma] will suffice.
