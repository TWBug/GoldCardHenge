"If you’d like to discuss: whether you should apply, benefits of the program, or any early questions:

* Read the Foreign Talent Act website
* Ask help@taiwangoldcard.tw, the Gold Card Helpdesk run by the National Development Council
* Ask Contact Taiwan. They are a Government-funded organisation whose mission is to help you find a job. They’ll direct you to the right place.

Otherwise, look at the master contact list to talk about:

* tax incentives: the NIA can sometimes provide some basic information about this, otherwise contact the Ministry of Finance under Reduction or Exemption of Income Tax of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list
* visas for your spouse/family: Contact NIA, under the Ministry of Interior for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals on the master list"
