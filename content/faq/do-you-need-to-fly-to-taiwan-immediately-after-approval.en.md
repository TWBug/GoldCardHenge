You do not need to travel to Taiwan right away. Some applicants take months to prepare for their arrival. When your application is officially approved, you will receive an email from the application portal. 

Your cards’ validity can start before you enter Taiwan or pick up your card. Keep this in mind when planning your move to Taiwan.

\*Note: Starting from December 1, 2020, until February 28, 2021, you’ll need a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result issued within three working days to be able to enter Taiwan.
