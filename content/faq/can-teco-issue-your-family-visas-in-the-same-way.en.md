"According to the travel restrictions, NDC informs that a special entry permit can still be applied for dependents of foreign nationals. You are considered a foreign national with your gold card. You should be able to apply for a permit for your family with just your approval letter, therefore it is recommended that you apply for it while getting your passport verified (to receive your gold card).
As with above, there may be some local hurdles depending on the office. So keep me informed of your discussions with TECO, and if you can take down the details at which point you are unable to proceed further, NDC will make the call to push things through."
