"Re-application" is for 1) those who have applied for a Gold Card for the second time (before 10/25/2021) or 2) those who apply for a Gold Card again after their Gold Card expires. The start date of the second Gold Card is the approval date of the re-application.

"Extension" is for those who applied for a second Gold Card after 10/25/2021 (including 10/25/2021). In this case, the start date of the second Gold Card is linked to first Gold Card. For example, if your first card expired on 11/25, then your second card's start date is 11/25.

Please note that the required documents for "re-application" are the same as those for an "extension," and you must meet the qualifications before applying.
