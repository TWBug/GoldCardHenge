If a foreigner has been previously approved to reside in the R.O.C. before his/her employment engaged in professional work in the R.O.C., such approval is not given because of his/her engagement in the professional work (such as residence for study or as dependents); therefore, the foreigner is exempt from the first-time approval limitation.
