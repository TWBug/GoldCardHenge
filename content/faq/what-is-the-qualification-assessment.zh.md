Around 2-4 weeks after submitting your application
{{< /message >}}

After a quick sanity check by the National Immigration Agency, your qualifications will be assessed. If you login to the portal to check your application status, you’ll see it go from “Under Review” to “待二審” (secondary inspection) to “Professional Review by Workforce Development Agency”.

Once your application reaches this stage, it will stay on this status for weeks.

**What’s happening in the background is:**

- First, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days).
- Most likely, the Ministry of Labor will need call in the appropriate Ministry (eg “Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application.

This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage.

If the status in the portal hasn’t updated in a long time first try contacting WDA, under the *Ministry of Labor for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals* on the [master contact list](https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&s=DA2F7BC919B77E24). They will probably tell you that the application is with the relevant ministry for your skill set and provide contact details. If not, try to contact the appropriate ministry under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list
