Obtaining the Employment Gold Card overseas will take at minimum, 21 working days. After receiving the Gold Card, the overseas mission will notify the applicant by email to pick it up. If the applicant does not pick up the card within three months, it will be mailed back to the National Immigration Agency in a diplomatic bag.

If you have waited for over a month and have not received a notification letter to pick up the Gold Card from the overseas mission, ​​please contact the National Immigration Agency at 886-2-2388-9393.
