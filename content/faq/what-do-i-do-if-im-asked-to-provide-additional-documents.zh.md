After a few weeks of tense wait, you may receive an email from **niasys@immigration.gov.tw** that says “After the examination by the department and the enterprise competent authority, the relevant information shall be made up.”.

Log in to the portal at: [immigration.gov.tw](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card)

Your application will be listed under “Application cases of which data to be supplemented”, click “View”.

Up the top of the application will be a block of red text in Chinese and English. It will attempt to explain what additional documents are required. If it doesn’t make sense, call the appropriate ministry contact under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list. They’ll be able to look up your application and provide more colour.

Once you know which documents to upload, prepare to upload them as with your previous application. Additionally, prepare a short statement addressing how you have rectified the “Opinion on the Application”. Select the documents for upload and paste the response in the “Reply Comments” box at the bottom of the final page.

*Important: Sometimes using English in the “Reply Comments” box will cause your application to fail to be submitted with a cryptic error.*
