When applying for the gold card from within Taiwan, some visa types are not transferable to the gold card, such as:

* International Conference Visa (IM)
* Trade Exhibition or other Events Visa (IM)
* Emergency Relief (ER)
* Medical Visa (M)
* Working Holiday Visa (WH/YM) **except for France Working Holiday**
* Studying Mandarin Chinese Visa (FR)

If you entered Taiwan with these visas, you must apply from abroad or re-enter Taiwan with another visa. You cannot convert these visas, and some others, to a Gold Card from within Taiwan.

Please remember to double check your passport to confirm your visa type. If you select the wrong visa on your application, you will be asked to reapply and will not be refunded.

Should you have any concerns about your visa type, please confirm with the [Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://www.boca.gov.tw/lp-191-2.html " to Bureau of Consular Affairs").
