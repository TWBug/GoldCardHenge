Please contact the Ministry that is currently reviewing your application and ask them to return your application so you can edit your passport number.

For example, if your application status is Review by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), please ask the WDA to return your application so you can edit your passport number on the application portal.

If your application status is Passport Inspection at the Bureau of Consular Affairs or Overseas Missions of R.O.C. (Taiwan), please ask BOCA or the Overseas Mission to return your application and so you can edit your passport number on the application portal.
