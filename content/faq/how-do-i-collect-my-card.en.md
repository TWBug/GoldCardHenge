After your identity is verified, a final review is conducted by the Ministry of Interior and your Gold Card will be issued. You will get an email at this point telling you your application has been approved - congratulations.

It’s time to collect your card (you selected where during your application)

- in Taiwan at the National Immigration Agency
- at your nearest Taiwanese diplomatic post

If you applied from overseas but are collecting your card in Taiwan, you will need to download your Resident Authorization Letter from the [portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card) and print it. Your airline will need to see this as proof of your ability to enter Taiwan, and you’ll show it to the border agent in Taiwan. After arriving, you may visit the [National Immigration Agency](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141386/127061/127076/) to collect your card.

Please note that [starting from December 1, 2020, until February 28, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/KIUJU0aZex70DPFUN3d66w?typeid=158&fbclid=IwAR3ITZrqBAkN-bCMZWmJbjxF4wS5XZlmLP7pP8ubK7mpqLeqsIhe8LuMTTk), you’ll need a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result issued within three working days to be able to enter in Taiwan.

You don’t need to go to Taiwan straight away: some people take months to prepare for their arrival. However, see the answer for When does the gold card’s validity begin? to determine whether that affects you.
