Generally not, but it depends. The document requirements to prove an Article 1 (“salary”) application all talk about “…verifying salary or income tax payment related to employment…”. The most commonly accepted documents appear to be withholding tax statements from employers and income tax returns from a tax authority. Bank statements are generally not sufficient. If you don’t have salary-based compensation for your employment, we recommend [calling ahead](https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/application/#who-can-i-talk-to-about-this). You may be able to make an argument if your freelance income looks a lot like salary (eg from the USA: “7 Nonemployee Compensation” on a [1099-MISC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) from before 2020 or a [1099-NEC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-nec) form after 2020).
