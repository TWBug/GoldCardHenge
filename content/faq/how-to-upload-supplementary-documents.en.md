Case Status Check → The List of Supplemental Documents → View → Modify → Upload Document (Please confirm that you have uploaded the correct documents. There is no preview option so please click "Next Step" continuously and click "Send" to submit)

If you do not submit your supplementary documents within 6 months, your application will be sent to the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) for a second review, and you will have to contact the WDA.

If you are asked to provide supplementary documents, but the validity period of your passport is less than 6 months, you will need to apply for a new passport. After you receive your new passport, you need to fill in your new passport number and validity period on the application platform. Please select your passport validity period by clicking on the calendar icon as shown in the photo(s) below.
