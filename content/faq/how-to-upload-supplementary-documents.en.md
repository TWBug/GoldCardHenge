(Please confirm that you have uploaded the correct documents. Currently, the preview option only shows your old documents, so please ignore the preview option, click “Next Step” continuously, then click “Send” to submit)

**Please update all required supplementary information or documents on the application portal within 30-days of receiving the National Immigration Agency's Notification to Provide Additional Documents (the update period is 6 months for applicants who must obtain additional documents abroad).**

If you do not submit your supplementary documents within 6 months, your application will be directly rejected by the Workforce Development Agency and you will not be refunded.

If you are asked to provide supplementary documents, but the validity period of your passport is less than 6 months, you will need to apply for a new passport. After you receive your new passport, you need to fill in your new passport number and validity period on the application platform. Please select your passport validity period by clicking on the calendar icon as shown in the photo(s) below.
