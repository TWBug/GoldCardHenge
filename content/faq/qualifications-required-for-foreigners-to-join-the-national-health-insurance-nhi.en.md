1. A foreign resident who holds a Resident Certificate in Taiwan may apply for National Health Insurance after a full 6 months of residence (having continuously stayed in Taiwan for 6 months, or having stayed in Taiwan for 6 months with a departure for less than 30 days; the actual duration of residence excludes the number of days spent abroad). However, those who become legally employed may apply for NHI on the date of employment. From December 1, 2017 onward, a newborn foreign infant who obtains a Resident Certificate in Taiwan will be eligible NHI upon the date of birth.
2. In accordance with the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals, which went into force on Oct. 25, 2021: foreign special professionals and foreign senior professionals who meet the criteria for being insured as employers or self-employed business owners may apply for NHI immediately upon receipt of their Resident Certificates. This policy extends to their dependents (spouses, minor children, and adult children who are unable to live independently) who have obtained their own Resident Certificate(s).
3. A foreign resident will lose NHI entitlement once their Resident Certificate expires, and they will be withdrawn from the NHI.
