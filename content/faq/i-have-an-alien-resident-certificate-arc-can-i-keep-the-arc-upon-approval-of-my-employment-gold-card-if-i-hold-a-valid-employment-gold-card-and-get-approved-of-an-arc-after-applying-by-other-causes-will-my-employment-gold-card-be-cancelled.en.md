1. The Employment Gold Card is a four-in-one cards that simultaneously works as work permit, residence visa, Alien Resident Certificate and Re-entry permit.  There is no need for its holder to apply for another Alien Residence Certificate.  To enforce the one-ARC-per-person policy for any foreigner residing in Taiwan, the applicant is given the option to make conversion between the ARC and the Employment Gold Card, but only one or the other.

2. If you already hold a valid Employment Gold Card but apply for and got issued an Alien Resident Certificate by other reasons, the NIA are bound by law to cancel your Employment Gold Card, though not af-fecting your rights to residency.

3. If you already have a valid ARC, be it by the reason of being an em-ployed white-collar worker or being the spouse of a registered ROC national, you are eligible for an Employment Gold Card once you meet the qualifications of a Foreign Special Professional.

4. In addition, if you want to convert your ARC to an Employment Gold Card, the NIA will cancel your ARC once you apply for and get issued the latter.
