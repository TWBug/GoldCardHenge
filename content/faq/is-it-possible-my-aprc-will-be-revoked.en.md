If you hold an APRC but have been abroad and have not entered Taiwan for over 5 years, or you are under the circumstances listed in Article 33 of the Immigration Act except the Paragraph 4, then your Permanent Resident Permit will be revoked or repealed and your Alien Permanent Resident Certificate will be canceled.
