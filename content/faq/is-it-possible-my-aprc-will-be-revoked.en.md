If you hold an APRC but have been abroad and have not entered Taiwan for over 5 years, or you are under the circumstances listed in the Article 33 of the Immigration Act except the Paragraph 4, than your Permanent Resident Permit will be revoked or repeal and your Alien Permanent Resident Certificate will be cancelled.
