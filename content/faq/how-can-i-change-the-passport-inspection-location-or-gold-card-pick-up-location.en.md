Changing the passport inspection location or Gold Card pick-up location: Login to the Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform → Application → Application for the change of passport inspection location (or certificate collection location)
**Please note that the location for the passport inspection and certificate collection should be the same. However, you are able to choose to collect the certificate in person (in Taiwan).**

Please note that the passport inspection location can be changed on the online platform before the approval of the Workforce Development Agency. After you have received an email notification of Passport Inspection Notification, you can no longer make changes online. Please contact the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) at boca2107@boca.gov.tw to make any changes.

The pick-up location can be changed on the online platform before the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) finishes reviewing your application. After you pass the WDA review, you can no longer change the pick-up location.
