Please note that the passport inspection location can be changed on the online platform before the approval of the Workforce Development Agency. **After you have received an email notification of the approval of your application, you can no longer make changes online.** Please contact the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to make any changes. 

The pick-up location can be changed on the online platform before passing the second review of the National Immigration Agency (NIA). **If you have received an email notifying that you've passed the second review, you can no longer make changes online.** For domestic applicants, please contact the NIA Service Center. For overseas applicants, please contact BOCA or MOFA to make changes.
