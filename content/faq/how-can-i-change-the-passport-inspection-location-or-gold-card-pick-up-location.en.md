Login to the Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform → Application → Apply to Change Passport Inspection or Card Collection Location.

The passport inspection and pick-up location can be changed on the online platform before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) finishes reviewing your application. After you pass the MOFA’s review, you can no longer change the passport inspection or pick-up location.
