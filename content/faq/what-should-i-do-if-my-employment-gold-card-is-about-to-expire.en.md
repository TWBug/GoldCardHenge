If the validity period of your Employment Gold Card is about to expire, to ensure the renewal of your residence period, it is recommended that you apply for the "Employment Seeking Resident Certificate" at the National Immigration Agencyâ€™s Service Center while you wait for the Gold Card review process (after obtaining the Employment Seeking Resident Certificate, you cannot work in Taiwan) or have your employer apply for a work permit for you at the Ministry of Labor.
