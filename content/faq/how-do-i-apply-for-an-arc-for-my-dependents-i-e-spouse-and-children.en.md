Dependents who enter with a Resident Visa should apply for an ARC within 15 days after entry into Taiwan. For more information on the ARC application process, please refer to <https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/141970/>

Dependents who enter on other visas, please refer to the FAQ on applying for a Resident Visa first. <https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/tags/family/>
