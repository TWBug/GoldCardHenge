The import of medicine, supplements, and medical supplies into Taiwan is highly regulated. You will need to obtain permission to import these by providing documentation for the quantity and a medical prescription for the users. You can apply for this process online, however, since the platform is in Chinese only, you may need to find someone to help you to make sure you have the proper information.

It is worth noting that Taiwan has a very developed medical and health system; you may search the equivalent medication in Taiwan through Medicine Scan (藥掃描) APP, please refer to [Overview of Drug Information Progress in Taiwan](https://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000232162.pdf).
