Q5. What is the cost of the group quarantine facility? How do I pay (cash, credit card, bank transfer)? Can I upgrade to a better facility at my own expense?

A5. People who apply to stay in a group quarantine facility at their own expense can log onto the Quarantine System for Entry Portal (https://hdhq.mohw.gov.tw). The fee is NT$2,000 per person each day, but children under the age of 12 who live in the same room as their father or mother will not be charged. After the quarantine person(s) enters Taiwan, they will be guided to an epidemic prevention taxi (self-paid) and go directly to the group quarantine facility. The group quarantine facility is assigned by the CDC, and the individual will not be able to select the quarantine location. When your quarantine is complete, please arrange for your own taxi or ask your family to pick you up.

Q10. Can a family live together? What if there are young children in need of care?

A10. The quarantine room is based on the principle of one person per room. If there are those who need care, such as infants or the elderly, there should be at most one caregiver, and masks must be worn in the quarantine room. The quarantined individual must stay within their own quarantine room, may not leave their room or enter another quarantined individual’s room without permission, and must eat in their own room. If any quarantined individuals leave their quarantine room without permission, they shall be fined according to law.
