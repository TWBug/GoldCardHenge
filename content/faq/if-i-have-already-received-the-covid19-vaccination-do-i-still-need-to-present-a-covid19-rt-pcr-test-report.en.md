Due to the severity of COVID19, and taking into consideration that the vaccine doesn't provide 100% immunity, and that the vaccination rate is not high in Taiwan, travelers who enter or transit through Taiwan who have already received the vaccine are still required to present a COVID19 RT-PCR test report and to comply with quarantine requirements as well as other related rules after entry in order to prevent the spread of COVID19 and protect the vulnerable in Taiwan.
