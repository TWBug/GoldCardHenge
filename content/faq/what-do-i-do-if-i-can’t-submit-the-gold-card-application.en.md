1. Check that each page of your Employment Gold Card Application has been successfully saved.
2. Ensure that you have answered every question with a red asterisk next to it.
3. Check that your passport photo and supporting documents have been uploaded successfully. Your passport photo should be 413 pixels wide and 531 pixels high. Please upload your supporting documents in PDF format.
4. Check to see if your application portal has popped up in a new window (please pay attention to your Logout Countdown; the NIA platform will redirect users who have spent more than 30 minutes on one page).
5. If your session has timed out, please log in again and re-submit your application.
