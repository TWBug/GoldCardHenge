If you’re getting your passport inspected at Taipei’s Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA)/Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Office, here is a quick how-to:

BOCA is open Monday to Friday from 08:30 to 17:00. It is located a few blocks from Shandao Temple Station, Exit 2. Enter the big pink building and go directly up the escalators to level 3.

On level 3, ignore the ticket machine immediately in front of you and turn right and right again to get to the “Authentication” area.

In the middle of the area, around counter 30, grab a ticket (if there is a problem, ask for help at the end counter - counter 28).

Go to the designated counter when your number is up, surrender your passport and online application document, provide any details on upcoming travel, and receive your receipt.
