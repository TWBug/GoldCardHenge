You must now select the duration for your card. You could opt for a shorter duration if you have concrete plans. Otherwise, it’s probably better to select the longest duration. There is no justification needed on how long you’d like to stay. This costs more, but delays the hassle of finding the next visa (or going through the gold card application process [again](https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/validity/)).

You’ll also be asked for a local address. It’s entirely normal and accepted to apply without one. Once you get a place to stay, you can (must) update the details on your card, [free of charge](https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/life-in-taiwan/#what-happens-if-i-change-my-address). Only fill an address out here if you’re confident you will be able to receive important documents there.

You must select where you will collect your card, there are two options to choose from:

- In Taiwan - generally faster, as your card does not need to be mailed overseas. You will use a printed Residence Authorization Certificate to enter Taiwan, which might require some explanation to your airline.
- At your local embassy - more convenient, as you can enter Taiwan with the process completed.

If you have information for any of the remaining fields, fill it in, or leave them blank if you dont. Click “save” and “next step” to go to the Profession section.
