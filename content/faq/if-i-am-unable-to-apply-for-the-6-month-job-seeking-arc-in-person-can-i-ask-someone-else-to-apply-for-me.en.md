If you are not in Taiwan, you may ask a friend or family member to act as your representative agent. In order to apply for the 6-month job-seeking ARC on your behalf, your agent must bring the following documents to the National Immigration Agency (NIA):

**Pandemic Conditions**

1. [A complete application form ](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/media/37407/application-form.pdf " to Multiple-purpose Application Form for Foreigners pdf")
2. An authorization letter
3. A copy of your passport
4. A copy of your Employment Gold Card
5. A passport-size color photo taken within 6 months
6. An application fee of NT$1,000

**Non-Pandemic Conditions**

1. [A complete application form](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/media/37407/application-form.pdf " to Multiple-purpose Application Form for Foreigners pdf")
2. An authorization letter. Must be verified by a Taiwanese embassy or overseas mission
3. Your original passport. If you cannot send your original passport back to Taiwan, please send it to the Taiwanese embassy of the country you are in at the time of application for Passport Authentication. Then, you may submit a copy of your passport + the passport authentication certificate in lieu of your original passport.
4. Your original Employment Gold Card
5. A passport-size color photo taken within 6 months
6. An application fee of NT$1,000

Please note: after your application is approved, your agent will need to return to the NIA, pick up your ARC card, and send it to you overseas, as you will need to present your physical ARC at immigration in order to re-enter Taiwan.

Should you have any questions or concerns about the process, please contact your local [National Immigration Agency Service Center](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141386/127061/127076/ " to National Immigration Agency Service Center page").
