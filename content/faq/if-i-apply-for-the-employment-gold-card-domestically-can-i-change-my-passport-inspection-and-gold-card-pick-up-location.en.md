If you have applied for the Gold Card domestically, you must get your passport inspected at Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) in Taiwan and collect your Gold Card at National Immigration Agency. You cannot change the passport inspection location and pick up location to overseas.

**If you need to leave Taiwan before you get your passport inspected, you must apply for another visa to enter Taiwan and have your passport inspected at BOCA in Taiwan.**
