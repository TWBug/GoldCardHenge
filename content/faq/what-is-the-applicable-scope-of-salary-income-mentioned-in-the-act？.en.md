1. The term "salary income" in the Act shall refer to the amount of aggregate salaries which may be calculated in the gross amount of income paid by domestic and offshore employers for the foreign special professional's engagement of professional work. Other salary unrelated to the foreign special professional's special expertise shall not be applicable to the tax incentives.
2. The above-mentioned salary income shall be applied to the tax incentives in the taxable year. For instance, according to Article 19-1 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation, where an individual who acquires stocks as an employee's bonus, he/she may opt to include the salary income in the gross income and declare their income tax in the year of transfer or book-entry transfer. So if a foreign special professional receive the salary income of stocks acquired as an employee's bonus according to Article 19-1 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation and opt to declare their income tax in the year of transfer, such income shall be calculated in salary income and applied to the tax incentives in the year of transfer.
