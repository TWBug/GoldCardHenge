Workers aged 60 years and older, with a seniority of less than 15 years, may claim a lump-sum payment; those with a seniority greater than or equal to 15 years may choose to claim a lump-sum payment or monthly payments. Seniority referred to shall be calculated based upon the period in which the contributions to the pension have been made. If the seniority of an employee is interrupted, both the foreign professionalâ€™s seniority before and after the interruption shall be combined in calculation.
