There is only one fee, which is paid through the Gold Card application portal. There are no separate visa or work permit fees.

The fees varies if you apply from Taiwan or overseas, the duration of the visa, and your nationality. You can check the [Fees for Employment Gold Card](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card) section of the application portal.
