If you have a Taiwanese bank account, you can apply online through <https://swis.mohw.gov.tw/covidweb/home/index_en.jsp>

If you do not have a Taiwanese bank account, you can provide a friend’s bank account information.
Visit your local District Office (區公所) to fill in a document called “帳戶異動切結書“, which states that you are using another account.

To apply in person, go to the District Office of the district in which you have completed your quarantine.
According to Taiwan’s Quarantine Subsidy, you can check your eligibility by calling the 1957 hotline.
