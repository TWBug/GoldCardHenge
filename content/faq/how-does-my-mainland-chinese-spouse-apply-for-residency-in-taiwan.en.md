Mainland Chinese spouses of Gold Card holders can apply for a Visitor Visa to enter Taiwan. They cannot apply for a Resident Visa nor can they convert to an ARC.

Please refer to this link for the Visitor Visa application for Mainland Chinese individuals, <https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5385/7244/7250/7257/%E5%81%9C%E7%95%99/36040/?fbclid=IwAR2C1DGWe8SoKD2yKyM4fa9NU6aM84kj2j1WyfwkcXWxyByTqtA2pkIxLls> or contact the National Immigration Agency at +886(2)-23889393 ext. 2692
