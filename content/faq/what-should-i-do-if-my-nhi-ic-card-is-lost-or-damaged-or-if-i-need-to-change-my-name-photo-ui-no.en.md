Please fill in the “NHI IC Card Application Form” available at your nearest Bureau of National Health Insurance branch or post office. Attach a photocopy of your identification card on the reverse side and present the completed form to the service personnel. There will be a card production fee of NT$200. If you choose to include your photo on your NHI IC Card, you will need to submit a 2” color or black and white full-face photo (hats and tinted glasses are not permitted). With a photo NHI IC Card, you will no longer need to present a second photo ID when seeking medical care using NHI coverage.
