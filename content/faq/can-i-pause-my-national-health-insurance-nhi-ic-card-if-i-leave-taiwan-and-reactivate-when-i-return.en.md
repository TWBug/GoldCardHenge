If you are planning to leave Taiwan for more than 6 months, you can apply to pause your NHI IC Card. You will not be required to pay the insurance fee while you are out of the country and can reactivate your card when you get back.

For more information, please contact the NHI IC Card Consultation Hot-line: 0800-030598
