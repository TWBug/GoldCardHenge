Congratulations on passing the skill assessment. It’s now time to deliver your passport for identity verification.

- If you are overseas, you should visit the nearest Taiwanese diplomatic post
- If you are in Taiwan, you must visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs

You will also need to take a copy of the “Passport Submission Notice”, which is found in the “Download” menu after logging in to the [portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card).
