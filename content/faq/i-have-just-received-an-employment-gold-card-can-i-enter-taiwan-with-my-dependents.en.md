The Employment Gold Card Online Application Portal is only for the applicant to apply for the Gold Card and not for their dependents. Once the applicant's application has been reviewed and approved, the accompanying family members can only apply after he/she enters Taiwan. According to Article 16, Item 2 of the [Laws and Regulations Regarding Hong Kong & Macao Affairs](https://www.mac.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=2EA6ADFC159E7A0D&sms=8675D7361543DE23&s=2D8A24629A688BEB), family members of the applicant who apply for residency separately must wait for the applicant to be granted entry and residence.
