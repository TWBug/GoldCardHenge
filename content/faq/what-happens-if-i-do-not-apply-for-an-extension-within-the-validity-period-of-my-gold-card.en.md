If you do not apply for an extension within the validity period of your Gold Card, you will not be able to apply for an extension and will have to re-apply for a Gold Card. This means that the Date of Issue for your reapplied Gold Card will not be able to continue from the expiration date of your previous card. This means that your stay in Taiwan as a Gold Card holder will be interrupted, which may affect your eligibility to apply for permanent residency after 3 years of residing in Taiwan. Instead, you need to stay in Taiwan for 5 consecutive years before you can apply for permanent residency.
