Yes, this card is perfect for you, since it contains an open work permit that allows you to work for any employer. However, if you don’t have a Taiwanese employer please see the answer to: [I’m a freelancer/I don’t have an employer, how do I register with the NHI?](https://taiwangoldcard.com/goldcard-holders-faq/health-insurance/).
