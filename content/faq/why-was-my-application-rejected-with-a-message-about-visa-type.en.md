You probably received an error message that looks like this: “申請人以免籤證入境，申請時身份類別選擇錯誤，不予許可” This translates to “You entered Taiwan ‘visa-exempt’, but when applying you selected the wrong visa/identity category, application refused.”

Don’t stress. You will have to make a new application, but your old one can be refunded. When [starting an application](https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/application/#starting-your-application) from inside Taiwan, you will be asked what visa you hold. A common mistake is to select “I entered R.O.C. with a visa of which the duration of stay is more than 60 days” because you have a stamp in your passport that says “90 days”. However, unless you explicitly applied for a visa to come to Taiwan, you are probably here under “visa exempt” entry, which was another item on that list.

The NIA looked up your visa status, found it incorrect, and rejected your application. What you need to do now is:

- Call NIA, using the phone number on the bottom of the application portal or the “Ministry of Interior” on the [official contact list](https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&s=DA2F7BC919B77E24), explain what happened and ask for a refund.
- Make a new application
