The term "first 3 years" in the tax incentives shall start from the year when the foreign special professional has resided in the R.O.C. for 183 days or more for the first time, and has an annual salary income over NT$3,000,000. The taxpayer can not choose the starting year and applicable years as he/she wishes.
