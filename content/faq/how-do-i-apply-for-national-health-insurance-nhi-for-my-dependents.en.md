If you are employed by a Taiwanese organization, they will enroll you in the program on your first day of work and arrange the issuance of your NHI card. If you are not working or working for a company overseas, then there is a six-month waiting period which starts from when you enter Taiwan on your Gold Card. Note that during this waiting period you can only leave Taiwan once for less than 30 days.

Once you are enrolled, your spouse and your minor children and adult children who are unable to live independently will be covered under your enrollment as 'dependents'.

To enroll your dependents in NHI, please bring your Gold Card, their ARCs, and your stamps to the [National Health Insurance Administration](https://www.nhi.gov.tw/English/ " to National Health Insurance Administration").
