If you are planning on applying for the salary qualification under either the Economy or Finance industry, you must provide:
1. a tax statement and/or salary statements from your employer to prove your salary was above 160,000NT (eg Australia PAYG payment summary, Canada T4, Israel 106 form, Russia 2-NDFL, Poland PIT-11, UK P60, US W-2)
Or
1. a copy of your upcoming employment contract for a job in Taiwan, showing monthly salary above 160,000NT

Most recent monthly salary of at least NT$160,000 means a monthly salary or average monthly salary of NT$160,000 or above within the three years preceding the month of the application.
