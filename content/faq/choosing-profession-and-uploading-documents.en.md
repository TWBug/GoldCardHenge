Here you must choose the field and regulation which you selected in Do I Qualify?. This can be changed later if necessary, but only after significant time has passed, so be sure to choose the correct entry. Then, click “save” and “next step” to upload your documents.

You must first upload a passport photo. Note that this has to be a proper passport photo that you would use for a visa application - a selfie will be rejected.

Next, you must upload a copy of your passport’s bio page. You don’t need to upload the whole thing, or any of the stamp pages - just the page that shows your profile information.

Finally, based on the regulation you are applying under you will need to upload required documents. If you need hints on what to upload, use the [Gold Card Qualification Check](https://visafinder.tw/gold-card-qualification/).

Do not stress about your application being rejected because you didn’t attach enough documents. The authorities will ask for more documents if the ones you provided were not sufficient. It’ll just extend the processing time by a couple of weeks to a month.

If your documents are not in English or Chinese, they probably need to be translated.
