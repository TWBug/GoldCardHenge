Unfortunately, once your application is submitted, regardless of the result of the application or if you revoke your application, there will be no refunds.

According to the National Immigration Agency's Article 4 of Employment Gold Card Application Instructions, after an applicant uploads all required documents to the Application Platform, one can choose the effective period of the Employment Gold Card between one year, two years, or three years. To complete the application process, one shall choose between “domestic” or “overseas” application and pay the applicable fees according to the fees shown when choosing the effective period for the Employment Gold Card with an international credit card. Regardless of the acceptance of the application, fees are nonrefundable.

Please refer to the [relevant regulations](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/168969/ " to relevant regulations page").
