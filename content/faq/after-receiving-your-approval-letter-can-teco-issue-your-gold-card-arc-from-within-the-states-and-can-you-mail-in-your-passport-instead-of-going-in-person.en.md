"Yes (and Yes), although there is some local discretion depending on the coronavirus situation. Typically, they do not accept mail-in passports for verification of identities; whether or not they do during this time is up to the local office.
San Francisco TECO actually posted a news update on March 16 (but only in Mandarin) stating that they were accepting mail-in documents for consular services to reduce contact. https://www.taiwanembassy.org/ussfo/post/6250.html
Boston TECO has a similar news update from April 7. https://www.roc- taiwan.org/usbos_en/post/2928.html
Itâ€™s unclear if that includes passport verification so best to check directly with them."
