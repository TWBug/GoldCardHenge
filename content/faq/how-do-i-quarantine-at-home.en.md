How do I quarantine at home?

Q1: Home (individual) quarantine is limited to "one person, one room", what does that mean?
A1: “One person, one room" means that during the quarantine period, the person quarantining must have their own separate, dedicated room (including dedicated bathroom) in the house.

Q2: Is it possible to quarantine at home if there is someone who is not quarantining in the house, but there will be a separate, dedicated room (including dedicated bathroom) for the person quarantining?
A2: As long as the person who is quarantining has their own separate, dedicated room (including dedicated bathroom), they may quarantine in the same house as someone who is not undergoing quarantine. 

Q3: What should I do if I need support or assistance while quarantining at home?
A3: Please contact the "Local Government Home Quarantine and Home Isolation Care Service Center" in your quarantine location for help and services.

Q4: Can I home quarantine in the rooftop addition of my house?
A4:  You may home quarantine in the rooftop addition if there is a separate, dedicated room (including dedicated bathroom).

Q5: The apartment I am renting is has two adjoining suites on the same floor (both with separate rooms and bathrooms) and share the same address. Can I use one of the suites for home quarantine while the other suite is not used for quarantine?
A5: If the suite you are staying in has a separate, dedicated room (including dedicated bathroom), you may quarantine in the suite. 

Q6: If a company rents a private, separate dormitory that follows the “one person, one room” rule and each individual has their own dedicated room and bathroom, can their employees quarantine in the dormitory?
Q6: As long as the dorm has a dedicated room and bathroom for each individual, then their employees may quarantine there. However, the company is responsible for managing and ensuring access control and security maintenance.

Q7: If an individual who is undergoing quarantine needs assistance taking care of themselves, can they quarantine and be taken care of by another individual who is also undergoing quarantine in the same house?
A7: If every individual in the house is undergoing quarantine, and there are no individuals present who are not quarantining, they may quarantine together in that house only after getting permission from the "Local Government Home Quarantine and Home Isolation Care Service Center" of their quarantine location. Once permission is granted, they may quarantine together without the restriction of “one person, one room” or be limited to one caregiver. Individuals that satisfy the condition above are as follows:
•	Children and minors (under 18)
•	Elders (over 65) who are unable to care for themselves 
•	People with disabilities
•	People with physical and mental disabilities 
•	People with serious injuries or illness 
•	Pregnant women, who according to the doctor, need special care during their pregnancy 
•	People who are unable to care for themselves due to injury or illness
•	Any other circumstances that have been evaluated and approved by the local government 

If the individual is quarantining in a government approved quarantine hotel, medical masks should be worn to the quarantine hotel. The local government will arrange appropriate transportation to the quarantine hotel and the room type will be decided by the local government and the "Taiwan Lodging Network / Epidemic Prevention Lodging Zone - Epidemic Prevention Lodging Window".

Individuals quarantining together should take proper precautions and preventative measures, such as frequent hand washing, wearing medical masks, maintaining good hygiene practices, social distancing, and not sharing food.

Q8: If an individual who is undergoing quarantine needs assistance taking care of themselves, can they quarantine and be taken care of by another individual who is not undergoing quarantine?
A8: If the individual meets the conditions below, they may quarantine with an individual who is not undergoing quarantine, only after getting permission from the "Local Government Home Quarantine and Home Isolation Care Service Center" of their quarantine location. Once permission is granted, they may quarantine together without the restriction of “one person, one room”. However, for risk management purposes, the caregiver is limited to one person and must be the same person throughout the entire quarantine period (cannot change caregivers). The caregiver will also undergo quarantine, set up the COVID geofencing app, monitor their health, and comply with the relevant regulations and precautions until the end of their quarantine period. 
•	Children and Minors (under 18)
