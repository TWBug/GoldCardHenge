Don’t stress. This is normal. You’re applying under a financial requirement, but the relevant ministry still wants to vet your skills. Under some interpretations of the regulations, they are not supposed to do this, but here we are.

Gather up some documents that demonstrate you work in the industry and you’re good at it. Maybe a letter from your boss talking about that time you created that innovative thing, a supporting statement from a professor about how they’re proud of you, a piece of easily digestible work product that has your name on it. It’ll depend on what you’ve got or can create - but get into the mindset of the reviewer and aim to make it as easy as possible to understand why you are a talent. If you feel the need, write a cover letter for your application explaining your skills.
