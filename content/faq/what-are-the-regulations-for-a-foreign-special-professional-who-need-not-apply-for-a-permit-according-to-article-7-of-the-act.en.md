1. The amount of income from salaries shall include all salaries after deducting the special deduction of income from salaries or necessary expenses. Assuming a special deduction of income from salaries NT$200,000 in this case, then a salary income of NT$8,000,000 (= NT$8,200,000 – NT$200,000).
2. Amount of non-taxable salary income = (NT$8,000,000 – NT$3,000,000)
   *50% =NT$2,500,000

   Amount of taxable salary income = NT$8,000,000-NT$2,500,000=NT$5,500,000
3. Overseas income NT$2,000,000 is excluded from basic income.
