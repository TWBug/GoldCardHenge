You must go to your local [Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA)](https://www.boca.gov.tw/lp-191-2.html). If you’re getting your passport vetted at Taipei’s BOCA/MOFA office, here’s a quick how-to. (Don’t worry, the ‘pinball’ method - shuffling between volunteers - works well too).

- BOCA is open between 08:30 to 17:00, [a few blocks from Shandao Temple Station, Exit 2](https://goo.gl/maps/mFt8PBMCGnD2)
- Enter the big pink building and go directly up the escalators to level 3
- On 3F, ignore the ticket machine immediately in front of you and turn right and right again to be at the “Authentication” area
- In the middle of the area, around counter 30, grab a ticket (if there is a problem, ask for help at the end counter - counter 28)
- Go to the designated counter when your number is up, surrender your passport and online application document, provide any details on upcoming travel, and receive your receipt.
