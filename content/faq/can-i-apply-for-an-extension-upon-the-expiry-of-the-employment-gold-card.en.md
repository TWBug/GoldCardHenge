The term of the Employment Gold Card cannot be extended since it is an open-end work permit issued to employment-seeking individuals that require neither confirmed hiring by nor application through the employer.  Periodic reviews and updates are needed on the applicant's work status and on potential changes in the qualification of the applicant.  Therefore, a new application should be filed prior to the Employment Gold Card's expiration.
