You may extend your Employment Gold Card 4 months before the expiration date on the Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform. After re-entering your personal information, the platform will automatically transfer your documents from your previous application (you will not be able to preview or download your previous documents). Please refer to the details as attached:

Please note that if you switch to a new Field or regulation, or if there are new regulations for the Field of your previous application, the platform will not be able to transfer your documents from your previous application.
Please note that there is no “Save” option, so please click “Next Step” continuously, then click “Send” to submit.
