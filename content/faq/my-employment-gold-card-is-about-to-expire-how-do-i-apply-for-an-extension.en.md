Please apply for an extension online via "Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform (Employment Gold Card)" at least 4 months before the expiration date on your card. You will need to upload your passport, a passport-size photo in color within 6 months, current Employment Gold Card, and the other documents required for your professional field of expertise. The application will be reviewed by the National Immigration Agency of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Labor. The applicant is able to choose the duration of the extension (1-3years).
