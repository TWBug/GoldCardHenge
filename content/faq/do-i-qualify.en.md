In order to qualify for an Employment Gold Card, your skills must be related to one of eight fields: Science and Technology, Economics, Education, Culture and Art, Sport, Finance, Law, or Architecture. You must select which ministry is most relevant, and in most cases, also select a specific qualification in that particular area for your application.

Feel free to use our [Gold Card Qualification Check](/en/apply/step-1/) to check your qualification.
