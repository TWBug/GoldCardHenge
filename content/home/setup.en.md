Please read the criteria for each relevant field carefully, as you may qualify under more than one field. However, you will be required to select only ONE field to apply under in the application.  In most cases, you need to choose a specific entry in the list of qualifications as well.

To validate your qualification, you will need to provide supporting documentation. Match your supporting documentation as closely as possible with the proposed specifications to ensure a speedy application.

Try the [Gold Card Qualification Check](https://visafinder.tw/gold-card-qualification/) to see which criteria you can consider in your application.
