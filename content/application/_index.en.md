* Choose the validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. There are different validation periods: One, Two, or Three years. Please choose according to your needs. The price of the application varies depending on the validity period of the card.

* Please choose the preferred location for collecting your Gold Card. If you are in Taiwan, please select your nearest National Immigration Agency Service Center. If you are abroad, select the nearest ROC agency. 
* Due to the pandemic, the Gold Card applications have suddenly skyrocketed. If there are no edits and additional documents needed the process right now will take up to 60 days to review.
* Beginning from July 28, 2021, the Gold Card Pick Up Location will be Restricted to Taiwan and there will no longer be an option for picking up the card at an overseas mission. Overseas and domestic applicants can download the Resident Authorization Certificate on the Application Portal to enter Taiwan. The Gold Card must be collected within 30 days of entering Taiwan at one of the National Immigration Agency’s Service Centers.
* If you currently don't have a work address, you can temporarily leave it out during the application and review stage.
