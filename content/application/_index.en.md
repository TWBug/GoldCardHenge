* Choose the validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. There are different validation periods: One, Two, or Three years. Please choose according to your needs. The price of the application varies depending on the validity period of the card.
* If you don't have any specific plans, we recommend choosing a longer validity period. If you want to extend at the end of your validity period, you will have to submit another application. Extensions are not possible.
* Please choose the preferred location for collecting your Gold Card. If you are in Taiwan, please select your nearest National Immigration Agency Service Center. If you are abroad, select the nearest ROC agency. 
* The ROC overseas mission Gold Card can take up to 21-working days before arriving at the overseas missions. Due to the pandemic, the Gold Card applications have suddenly skyrocketed. If there are no edits and additional documents needed the process right now will take up to 60 days to review.
* Additionally, we recommend choosing the pick-up location of the actual Gold Card in Taiwan, as many overseas offices are closed due to the pandemic. If you wish to come to Taiwan as soon as possible while abroad, please choose to pick up the Gold Card in Taiwan. You may enter the country with a Resident Authorization and collect the card after you arrive. For detailed instructions on how to pick up your Gold Card, please refer to Step 3.
* If you currently don't have a work address, you can temporarily leave it out during the application and review stage.
