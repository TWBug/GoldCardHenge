# Application Process

Applying for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is not that difficult. It’s as simple as filling out your personal information, attaching the necessary supporting documents, and paying the application fee. The whole process shouldn’t take more than 15-minutes. 
We have prepared a step-by-step guide to lead you through the process. Before filling out the application form, read our qualification section, and prepare all required documents. 

STEP 1: Go to the Application Platform
Please visit the website of the National Immigration Agency to access the application platform. https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/ and set up an account. Use the login details to login into the portal. 
Note: The English name needs to be consistent with the name on your passport you are using to enter Taiwan.

STEP 2: Fill in our information
After you have successfully registered, login, and select "Employment Gold Card Application" in the menu "Online Application." 
Notes for domestic application: 
If you have a household registration (e.g., Taiwan ID), you cannot apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. 
If you are a National without household registration, you need to enter the country with a non-ROC passport. 
If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly switch to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying. Or apply from abroad. 
The application can take 60-working days or more. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, if you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you still need to leave the country and re-enter. 

After entering the application page, please fill out the applicant's information. All fields with an asterisk are mandatory. Please make sure that the English name is the same as the passport used to enter Taiwan. You can save the filled out information at any time, come back to it later, and change before sending it.

In the visa application (passport inspection) tab, select the location for passport inspection. 
If the applicant is in Taiwan, you can choose to submit your passport for inspection at the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Central, Southern, Eastern, Yunlin, Jiayi, and Tainan branches).
If the applicant is abroad, choose your nearest ROC overseas mission/office. (!) In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, some foreign agencies might be closed and only accept passports by post. 

Choose your validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. There are different validation periods: One, Two, or Three years. Please choose according to your needs. 
Note: If you don't have any specific plans, we recommend choosing a longer validity period. If you want to extend at the end of your validity period, you will have to reapply. Extensions are not possible. 

In the "Profession" tab, please select the industry that you want to apply through. Please attach all relevant supporting documents. Click save after double-checking and uploading the files. 
Note: The Taiwan Employment Gold Card can take up to 21-working days before arriving at the overseas missions. If you would like to come to Taiwan as soon as possible while abroad, please choose to pick up the Gold Card in Taiwan. 

STEP 3: Upload your files
Please upload 
Color copy of your passport with at least 6-month validity remaining 
2-inch hatless facial color photo taken within six months (size identical to the Identification Card of our country) 
Attach relevant supporting documents. Documents need to correspond to the requirements based on the qualification the applicant chooses to apply through. 

If the provided documents are neither in English nor Chinese, please attach a translation to English or Chinese. 

Documents issued in the Mainland area have to be attested and examined by the institutions instituted or appointed by the Executive Yuan, or non-governmental organizations entrusted by the Executive Yuan (Strait Exchange Foundation) following the rule in Article 7 of "Act Governing Relations between Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area."

An overseas ROC representative office must verify documents from the following countries/regions: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bengal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cuba, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Notes: 
The uploaded passport copy must be the same as the passport used for the visa application
Please provide supporting documents as complete and extensive as possible following the eligibility requirements. If you are required to send in more supporting documents, the processing time can extend multiple weeks to a month.

STEP 4: Payment and E-Mail Confirmation
After the online application is complete, the system will send an e-mail with a 12-digits application number.
Please login to the platform again with your account and password and enter the "Online Payment" tab.
 Please pay according to instructions. Payment is only possible with an international credit card. However, if you are in Taiwan, you can print the payment slip and pay at a convenience store.\
After completing the application, you will get a system confirmation via e-mail. Your application has now entered the review process. 
To check your application process, log in to the portal, click "Application Progress Inquiry", and fill in your 12-digits application number. 

Note: The application fee is nonrefundable no matter the results of the application. If you choose not to use the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, you will not be eligible for a refund either. 

What happens after you fill out the application?
