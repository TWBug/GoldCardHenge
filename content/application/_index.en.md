{{< base >}}
Notes for Domestic Application: 

* To apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, you need to enter the country with a non-ROC passport. 
* ROC Nationals with household registration in Taiwan who entered the country with a non-ROC passport need to go to the local household registration office to cancel their household registration first.
* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly switch to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying. Or apply from abroad. 
* The application can take 60-working days or more. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, if you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you still need to leave the country and re-enter.

At this point, please bring your original passport to your chosen Bureau of Consular Affairs or ROC mission/office. **Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some overseas missions might be temporarily closed. If that is the case, please send in your passport, including a return envelope (with address and stamped).**

{{< base >}}
Notes:

* You can change the passport inspection location anytime on the online platform before the application has finished the review process.

## Submitting Additional Documents & Rejection

After the applicant completes the online payment, the review process officially begins. As the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a combination of four different certificates, three ROC authorities need to review the application. The National Immigration Agency conducts the first step of the review process and then passes it to the Ministry of Labor. Here they will consult with your relevant Ministry and check your qualifications. The final stop is at the Bureau of Consular Affairs for the last visa review.

**If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information and files, etc., you will need to resubmit documents, or your application can be rejected.**

* Please make sure to choose the right visa category that you have entered the country with, e.g., Visa-free, Student visa, visitor visa, etc.
* Incomplete information: 

  * No supporting documents for your application qualifications
  * Incorrect documents (e.g. No official tax statements)
  * Documents are not in English/ or Chinese.
  * Documents are from certain countries/regions but not verified.

* Insufficient documents:

  * If your documents can't prove that you are meeting the requirements, you will be asked to submit more documents. If you are not able to submit sufficient documents, your application will be rejected.
