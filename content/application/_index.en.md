Notes for domestic application: 

* To apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, you need to enter the country with a non-ROC passport. 
* ROC Nationals with household registration in Taiwan who entered the country with a non-ROC passport need to go to the local household registration office to cancel their household registration first.
* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly switch to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying. Or apply from abroad. 
* The application can take 60-working days or more. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, if you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you still need to leave the country and re-enter.
{{< /base >}}

* After entering the application page, please fill out the applicant's information. All fields with an asterisk are mandatory. Please make sure that the English name is the same as the passport used to enter Taiwan. You can save the filled out information at any time, come back to it later, and change before sending it.
* If you are applying from abroad or are in Taiwan on a visitor-visa, visa-free, or a non-extendable visa, your passport needs to be inspected. An extra page will appear during the application process, where you can choose the location. If you are in Taiwan, please go to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Central, Southern, Eastern, Yunlin, Jiayi, and Tainan branches). **In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, some foreign agencies might be closed and only accept passports by post.** 
* Choose your validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. There are different validation periods: One, Two, or Three years. Please choose according to your needs.

Note:

* If you don't have any specific plans, we recommend choosing a longer validity period. If you want to extend at the end of your validity period, you will have to reapply. Extensions are not possible.
