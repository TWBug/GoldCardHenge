# Application Process

Applying for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is not a difficult task.  Filling out and submitting the online form takes around 15-minutes, but only if you have all the required documents prepared.  Therefore, before filling out the application form, read the qualification section carefully and prepare all your required documents. Once you are ready, follow on with this step-by-step guide to lead you through the process.  It is as simple as filling out your personal information, attaching the necessary supporting documents, and paying the application fee. 

{{< base >}}
Required Documents

1. Color copy of your passport with at least 6-month validity remaining
2. 2-inch color passport/identification photo taken within six months (size identical to the Identification Card of our country, with clear resolution and without any hats or headwear). Check the specification on the application form if you are unsure. 
3. Attach the required supporting documents. Documents need to correspond to the requirements based on the qualification you have chosen to apply for.
4. Your previous Taiwanese visa and residence permit (if any).

With all the correct documentation submitted, it can take over 30 business days to complete the entire Employment Gold Card application process. If you are already in Taiwan, please make sure you have enough time remaining on your existing visa. If not, you may need to exit and re-enter the country, even if you are currently applying for a gold card.

Fill in your information / Passport & Visa Status
{{< /teaser >}}

* After you have successfully registered, login and select "Employment Gold Card Application" in the "Online Application" menu. Then select your nationality and whether or not you are applying from Taiwan or abroad.
* You may apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card if you hold a foreign passport, or a ROC passport without household registration. ROC nationals with a household registration or national ID card are not eligible to apply for the Gold Card.
* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly transfer to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying, or will need to apply from abroad.
* If you are applying from abroad or are in Taiwan on a visitor-visa, visa-free, or a non-extendable visa, your passport needs to be inspected. An extra page will appear during the application process, where you can choose the location. If you are in Taiwan, please go to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Central, Southern, Eastern, Yunlin, Jiayi, and Tainan branches). **In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some foreign agencies might be closed and only accept passports by post.**
* The application can take over 30 business days assuming you have all the proper documentation submitted. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, or you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you will still need to leave the country and re-enter.

If you are abroad, select the nearest ROC agency. **Due to COVID-19, many ROC agencies are temporarily closed. If so, please contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to change the pick-up location.**

You may enter the country on a temporary certificate and collect the card after you arrive. For detailed instructions to pick up your Gold Card, please refer to Step 3.
* If you currently don't have a work address, you can temporarily leave it out during the application and review stage. You may leave your Taiwan relative/friend’s resident address if you have no residence address. However, you must provide a residential address within 30 days of arriving in Taiwan.

{{< teaser >}}

{{< /teaser >}}

At this point, please bring your original passport to your chosen Bureau of Consular Affairs or ROC mission/office. **Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some overseas missions might be temporarily closed or working remotely. Please contact their office and see if passport inspections can be accepted via post.** 
* After verification, you will receive an e-mail stating your passport has been inspected and the gold card application was approved. Under normal circumstances, this process should take a week.

{{< base >}}
Notes:

* You can change the passport inspection location anytime on the online platform before the application has finished the review process. You will not be able to make online changes after you receive the e-mail confirmation that your application has passed review. At this point, you can only change the location by contacting the Bureau of Consular Affairs (from overseas) or contacting the National Immigration Agency (from within Taiwan).
* If you send your passport via post to an overseas mission/office, please make sure you don't have to use your passport within a month.

## STEP 3: Receiving your Gold Card

After your application has been approved, you will receive an e-mail notifying you to collect your Gold Card. Please bring your original passport and relevant documents to your selected location for picking up your Gold Card. If it is not convenient to pick it up in person, you can ask a friend or agent. In that case, you need to provide them with a power of attorney form.

**During the COVID-19 pandemic, the overseas mission may be temporarily closed and unavailable. If this happens, you can change the pickup location by contacting the Bureau of Consular Affairs (from overseas) or contacting the National Immigration Agency (from within Taiwan).**

## Submitting Additional Documents & Rejection

After you complete the online payment, the review process officially begins. As the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a combination of four different certificates, authorities from different departments will review your application. The National Immigration Agency conducts the first step of the review process and then passes it to the Ministry of Labor. Here they will consult with your relevant Ministry and check your qualifications. The final stop is at the Bureau of Consular Affairs for the last visa review.

**If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information, or the authorities require more information about your qualifications, you will need to submit additional documents for review. Failing to do so can result in your application being rejected.** 

* Please take the time to check which visa you have entered the country with, and choose the right visa category as this cannot be changed later, e.g., Visa-free, Student visa, visitor visa, etc.
* Incomplete information:

  * No supporting documents for your application qualifications
  * Incorrect documents (e.g. No official tax statements)
  * Documents are not in English or Chinese.
  * Documents are from certain countries/regions but not verified.

    * Mainland China, Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cuba, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc.
* Insufficient documents:

  * If your documents cannot prove that you are meeting the requirements, you will be asked to submit more documents. If you are not able to submit sufficient documents, your application will be rejected.

If you need to change information or provide more supporting documents, you have 30-days to do so. However, if your documents are only available abroad, you have a 6-months time frame to provide them. [Your application will be rejected if you can't uphold the time limit.](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0080204)
