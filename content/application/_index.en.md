## STEP 1: Online Application

{{< teaser prefix="1." >}}
Registration
{{< /teaser >}}

* Please visit the website of the [Foreign Professionals Online Application Platform](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/) to access the application platform, and set up an account. Use the login details to login into the portal. **The English name needs to be consistent with the name on your passport you are using to enter Taiwan.**

{{< teaser prefix="2." >}}
Fill in our information
{{< /teaser >}}

* After you have successfully registered, login, and select "Employment Gold Card Application" in the menu "Online Application." Also, select the applicant's nationality and whether or not you are applying from Taiwan or abroad.

{{< base >}}
Notes for Domestic Application: 

* To apply for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, you need to enter the country with a non-ROC passport. 
* ROC Nationals with household registration in Taiwan who entered the country with a non-ROC passport need to go to the local household registration office to cancel their household registration first.
* If you are currently on a working holiday visa or a student visa for Chinese learning purposes, you cannot directly switch to a Taiwan Employment Gold Card. You will need to re-enter the country before applying. Or apply from abroad. 
* The application can take 60-working days or more. If you hold a visa less than 60-days or are visa-free, if you cannot obtain the Taiwan Employment Gold Card within the time limit, you still need to leave the country and re-enter.
{{< /base >}}

* After entering the application page, please fill out the applicant's information. All fields with an asterisk are mandatory. Please make sure that the English name is the same as the passport used to enter Taiwan. You can save the filled out information at any time, come back to it later, and change before sending it.
* If you are applying from abroad or are in Taiwan on a visitor-visa, visa-free, or a non-extendable visa, your passport needs to be inspected. An extra page will appear during the application process, where you can choose the location. If you are in Taiwan, please go to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Central, Southern, Eastern, Yunlin, Jiayi, and Tainan branches). **In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, some foreign agencies might be closed and only accept passports by post.** 
* Choose your validity period for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card. There are different validation periods: One, Two, or Three years. Please choose according to your needs. 

{{< base >}}
Note:

* If you don't have any specific plans, we recommend choosing a longer validity period. If you want to extend at the end of your validity period, you will have to reapply. Extensions are not possible.
{{< /base >}}

* Please also choose the preferred location for picking up your Gold Card. If the applicant is in Taiwan, please select your nearest Immigration bureau. If the applicant is abroad, select the nearest ROC agency. **Due to COVID-19, many ROC agencies are temporarily closed. If so, please contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to change the pick-up location from the internal system.**

At this point, please bring your original passport to your chosen Bureau of Consular Affairs or ROC mission/office. **Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some overseas missions might be temporarily closed. If that is the case, please send in your passport, including a return envelope (with address and stamped).**

## 退補件說明

當申請人完成線上繳費後，審查程序就正式啟動。由於就業金卡是四證合一，需經過三個中華民國主管機關審核，分別是內政部移民署進行資料初審，再由勞動部會商其他部會進行資格複審，最後由外交部進行簽證審核。申請人通常在初審與複審階段，會因為所選簽證總類錯誤、資料準備不齊全、所選領域資格不符等，而需要資料補件、重新遞件或是申請被駁回。

* 簽證總類錯誤：例如持免簽入境台灣卻在申請時選擇「持停留期限六十天以上且未經簽證機關加註限制不准延期或其他限制簽證入國」。
* 資料準備不齊全：沒有依據所選領域的資格條件提供可證明文件，例如未提供官方財稅證明文件；所提供資料非中英文且未檢附英文或中文譯本；文件是由以下國家/地區發行卻未經過驗證。

  * 大陸地區、阿富汗、阿爾及利亞、孟加拉、不丹、緬甸、柬埔寨、喀麥隆、古巴、迦納、伊朗、伊拉克、寮國、尼泊爾、尼日、奈及利亞、巴基斯坦、塞內加爾、索馬利亞、斯里蘭卡、敘利亞、菲律賓、泰國、越南、馬來西亞、印尼等。
* 資格不符：申請人所提供的證明文件無法滿足所選擇的資格條件，例如月平均薪資經所得期間的最佳匯率計算仍未達新臺幣16萬元以上；所提供的證明文件無法判斷是否在專業領域具有重要貢獻或獨到才能；相關工作經驗年限累積未達規定等。

若因資料不符或欠缺者，經郵件通知後須於30日內補正；若申請資料須至境外申請，補正期間為6個月。屆期未補正或補正不完全者，駁回申請。
