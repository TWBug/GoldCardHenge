Skymizer is developing a software stack for deploying AI models at various types of AI system-on-chips, from high-performance cloud to cost-effective edge devices. As a software engineer of AI calibration, you will help develop a so-called “calibrator” tool for quantizing the data precision of AI models under the target machine’s constraints. Your contribution is important for enabling those exciting deep neural network models really working in the daily life. Without calibrator, a deep neural n
